AS web developer 
So that I can save website regular 
I will like to show a list of bookmarks

![Bookmark model](./Users/student/Projects/week-4/Bookmarks/Screenshot 2020-09-22 at 14.27.45.png)

## To set up the database

connect to 'psql' and create the 'bookmark_manager' database

````
CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manger;
````

To set up the right tables, connect to the database in 'psql' and run the SQL scripts in the 'db/migrations' folder in the given order.
